#Main issue I had was trying to get the code to work in the terminal. I just replaced prompt with readme. Prompt was in the original code on the website reference above.

const readlineSync = require('readline-sync');

// Program for a simple calculator
let result;

// Take the operator input
const operator = readlineSync.question('Enter operator (either +, -, * or /): ');

// Take the operand input
const number1 = parseFloat(readlineSync.question('Enter first number: '));
const number2 = parseFloat(readlineSync.question('Enter second number: '));

switch (operator) {
    case '+':
        result = number1 + number2;
        console.log(`${number1} + ${number2} = ${result}`);
        break;

    case '-':
        result = number1 - number2;
        console.log(`${number1} - ${number2} = ${result}`);
        break;

    case '*':
        result = number1 * number2;
        console.log(`${number1} * ${number2} = ${result}`);
        break;

    case '/':
        if (number2 !== 0) {
            result = number1 / number2;
            console.log(`${number1} / ${number2} = ${result}`);
        } else {
            console.log('Error: Division by zero');
        }
        break;

    default:
        console.log('Invalid operator');
        break;
}
