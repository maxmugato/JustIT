#Main issue I had was trying to get the code to work in the terminal. I just replaced prompt with readme. Prompt was in the original code on the website reference above.
#Another issue was the prompt to do another calculation. This was solved by a classmate posting their own code.

const readlineSync = require('readline-sync');

// Function to perform the calculation
function performCalculation() {
    // Program for a simple calculator
    let result;

    // Take the operator input
    const operator = readlineSync.question('Enter operator (either +, -, * or /): ');

    // Take the operand input
    const number1 = parseFloat(readlineSync.question('Enter first number: '));
    const number2 = parseFloat(readlineSync.question('Enter second number: '));

    switch (operator) {
        case '+':
            result = number1 + number2;
            console.log(`${number1} + ${number2} = ${result}`);
            break;

        case '-':
            result = number1 - number2;
            console.log(`${number1} - ${number2} = ${result}`);
            break;

        case '*':
            result = number1 * number2;
            console.log(`${number1} * ${number2} = ${result}`);
            break;

        case '/':
            if (number2 !== 0) {
                result = number1 / number2;
                console.log(`${number1} / ${number2} = ${result}`);
            } else {
                console.log('Error: Division by zero');
            }

        default:
